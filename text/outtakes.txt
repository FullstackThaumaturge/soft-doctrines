## Shattered Harmonies

### Annelise
*Crouch End, 22 December, 01:30 - 100 years after Nationfall*

"When you told Isaac that you had had enough and wanted out, but wanted to make as memorable an exit as possible, you presented him with a challenge he couldn't resist."

---

It was a fair question; she had only found the nerve to suggest it the night before when she had begged Isaac to drop everything and come to London in time to escort her to the Winter Solstice charity gala that followed the annual Winter Pops concert at the Royal Albert Hall. She had finally reached the limit of her patience because Morgan had gone haring off to Shenzhen[^5] to do some wet work in the middle of their rehearsals two days before, and had not returned until it was time for Crowley's Thoth to take the stage. Making matters worse, he had taken the stage in full uniform, shattering the pretense that the Adversary and the rock star were two different men. 

"He's a monster pretending to be a man," Annelise had said when appealing to Isaac, "and I can't keep lying to myself and pretending that I don't see the monster when he's standing before me reeking of somebody else's blood, ozone, and God knows what else."

Rather than immediately answer Elisabeth's question, she turned toward Samuel. "If I open my closet, can you muffle that?"

His first response was a derisive snort. "Easily enough, but aren't you already packed?"

Rather than answer, Annelise put Samuel's boast to the test. The bedroom closet was still mostly full; there was nothing in there that she had wanted to take with her, and she had packed light lest an investigator suspect there was more to the scene than met the eye. In a dark corner, however, rested one thing she meant to use but not to take with her. She grasped the lacquered scabbard and brought it into the light.

"That's one of Morgan's swords," said Elisabeth.

"He left it here a few years ago. In case there was a break-in and I needed to protect myself. Never mind that all I knew of swordfighting was that holding the sharp end was the other bastard's job and I had no intention of learning more."

Both Elisabeth and Samuel favored her with sharp glances; they were well aware that Isaac had insisted that she learn more than that. She put the lie to her own words by drawing the blade with practiced ease. It was a shorter blade, meant more for fighting indoors in tight spaces. Her grip was firm and her arm steady as she watched the light play along the ripples in the steel. "You wanted to know if I had thought this through? I've been thinking it through for the last year or so."

"Have you?"

Annelise pointed the sword at Christabel, who remained asleep. "I can't have my life back until *she* is dead. Morgan won't become what Isaac needs him to be as long as he can play rockstar with me and Naomi. Using this sword will implicate him and drag into the light all of the crimes he committed on the Phoenix Society's behalf. I just wish I could fake his fingerprints and Naomi's so that it looks like they murdered Christabel together."

«Leave Naomi out of this, bitch.»

The threat came to Annelise through her implant as an anonymous text message. "Somebody just threatened me via text."

"That seems unlikely," said Samuel. "The concealment I worked also blocks radio transmissions. The sender would have to be inside the affected area."

Annelise glanced at the sword in Naomi's lap. It had always given her the creeps, for she had never seen a sword made of eigengrau crystal with platinum veins. Worse, the veins seemed to slowly pulse as if alive and only temporarily quiescent. When she had mentioned it to Isaac, he had given her a cryptic warning about a pulp author having stumbled upon a fragment of the truth without realizing it and incorporating it into his fiction. "Naomi talks to that thing. She *reads* to it at night sometimes."

"How would you know that?" Elisabeth glanced at Naomi, who remained asleep. "I doubt she flaunts such peculiarities in public when she is almost as invested as maintaining a facade of mundane humanity as Morgan."

"I was sharing a room with her on tour because Morgan and I were on the outs and I didn't want to waste money on a room of my own. I woke up at zero dark thirty and found her reading to the damn thing. After she put it away and ducked into the loo I got a look at the book she was reading. Something about some bloke whose sword liked to snack on his friends when there weren't any enemies handy. I bet she had filched it from Morgan; it seemed like the sort of trash *he* might consider heavy reading[^6]."

"No, it's Naomi's," said Samuel. "You should ask Isaac about the packages he'd send her for her birthday and Winter Solstice."

"Whatever." Annelise stared at the sword. Was its veins pulsing a bit faster? No, she insisted to herself; she was just being paranoid. It had to be her imagination. Neverless, she could not keep the question to herself. "What if that thing could somehow talk back?"

Elisabeth favored her with one of her usual tight smiles. "You think that possible?"

"After everything I've seen since Isaac put Borgia Pizza out of business and invited me along on this magical mystery tour? Why the hell not? Where the hell *is* he, anyway?"

"Right here," said Isaac, stepping out of a dark corner. He considered the sword in Annelise's hand. "One of Morgan's, is it not?"

The sword fell from her hand as she realized who had just spoken to her. If not for the rug, its impact might have resounded through the room. "Sweet holy *shit*. Do you have to keep showing up like that?"

"It would hardly have done to walk in via the front door again. Are you ready?"

"I had recently asked Annelise if she had thought this through," said Elisabeth. "I am not yet convinced that she has done so."

"Nor am I," said Samuel. He favored Annelise with a pointed look that he soon turned on Isaac. "I doubt either of you know Morgan and Naomi as well as you think you do. Assuming they don't end up imprisoned for the murder pending a one-way trip for two to Uranus, what's to stop them from figuring out that you're trying to manipulate them into coming after Isaac?"

"Does it matter?" Annelise might have been the only human being in the room, the only one without any sort of extrasensory perception or preternatural talent, but she was determined that this remain *her* show. "Even if Morgan figures out that Isaac is yanking his strings, do you think his pride will allow him to let it go? Especially if the Phoenix Society throws him under a maglev by exposing all of the wet work he's done for you as unauthorized and illegal operations? Trust me, they'll be able to hear him doing an *a capella* cover of 'Screaming for Vengeance' from one end of the solar system to the other and to hell with the physics."

"The presence of your guest might complicate matters," said Elisabeth.

"No, it'll make this even better. Just think about it," said Annelise. "Naomi wakes up the next morning, either on her own or because MEPOL's just kicked down the door. What do you think she's going to see first? Morgan's sword driven through Christabel's heart to the hilt, pinning her to the bed. It's a goddamn Nakajima blade, custom made, and marked accordingly. No matter how determined she might be to stand by Morgan, she's gonna wonder if maybe he actually did do the job. Worse, because it will be obvious that she didn't try to stop him, everybody's going to think she either stood by and watched him or had her hands on the hilt alongside his."

Turning to the bed, Annelise brushed aside some of Christabel's chestnut curls to reveal a faint scar on her neck. "I mean, I don't know how you managed to produce this double on such short notice, but she's *perfect*. She's even got that little scar from that time my E string snapped and cut me while I was recording the second *Shattered Harmonies* album with Morgan."

A moment's remorse washed over Annelise as she remembered that injury. Seeing it, Morgan had immediately stopped playing and scrambled to find a first aid kit. He had insisted on seeing to Christabel, sure that the cut was worse than it had been. "I still remember how he had freaked out when he had seen me bleeding. You'd have thought I had been shot."

"He cared about you," said Elisabeth. "He still does. At least, you should hope he still does; the outcome of this drama you've concocted with Isaac depends on it. Likewise, it depends on Naomi remaining generous enough to refrain from writing you off."

"She's here, isn't she?" Isaac made to tousel his daughter's hair for a moment before withdrawing his hand. "That she is asleep and not sitting vigil is due to your determination to overcome hers', Ashtoreth."

"Names." It was Annelise who snapped the admonition. "You might recall that I have Witness Protocol running. Yes, you can have the recordings doctored, but it's better to avoid the necessity in the first place."

"Who put her in charge of this chickenshit outfit?" Though the words might have been contemptuous if taken at face value, Samuel had spoken with amused affection. Her force of personality had gone far toward making Annelise the partner in this enterprise that she was determined to be, rather than a mere pawn in Isaac's game.

---

That was a question with which Annelise had wrestled ever since Morgan had gone haring off to Shenzhen[^5] a couple of nights before the semiannual Solstice Pops concert at the Royal Albert Hall. He had returned barely in time to join Crowley's Thoth on stage and had been in full uniform, disheveled, and still stinking of violence. That had been the final straw. She had begged Isaac to accelerate the plan. It was only fitting; Winter Solstice was the perfect night for murder. "I've had my fill of revenge. The look on Morgan's face when I ended the band was priceless."

Glancing at Naomi, who remained asleep, Annelise lowered her voice. "He would have dumped me and quit years ago if not for Naomi. Crowley's Thoth wouldn't have become what it was without her, and he didn't want it to be yet another band that had imploded around her."

"It almost sounds as if you had been wrong about him all along," said Elisabeth, her arch tone leavened with something Annelise suspected to be compassion.

"Maybe I was." Annelise spoke softly, as if admitting this more to herself than to Elisabeth and Samuel. "I spent years sure I understood Morgan. I thought he loved being an Adversary as much as he did being on stage with me and Naomi. I was sure that with every mission he happily conducted symphonies of destruction. But when he came back reeking of blood, gunpowder, and ozone all I could see was my *idea* of him."

It had been an error for which Annelise would not easily forgive herself. She had known better, had trained herself to see past the posturing and theatrics with which Morgan Cooper created the image of a relentless avenger of the downtrodden. His weapons bore the motto *nemo me impune lacessit* not as a boast, but as a warning[^6]. Those who tried and failed to strike Morgan down carried their regrets to unmarked graves. Those who succeeded secured but a fleeting victory, for once Morgan had repaired himself he would resume the hunt with renewed conviction.

Though Annelise had initially dismissed these antics as Morgan's efforts to make his job easier by weaponizing terror, she received periodic updates to his dossier and could not ignore the truth of his actions on the job. His understanding of his interdependence with the world around him was deeper than he had ever let on. If a suspect was set on death because the legally prescribed punishment for their crimes was expropriation of their wealth and exile, which would impoverish their otherwise blameless families, Morgan would oblige them with as gentle a death as one could provide with a blade. All he asked was that they strike the first blow, that he might be justified in the use of deadly force.

However, if a suspect harmed innocent people or attacked a fellow Adversary, it was not a compassionate sword that awaited them. Annelise had seen a recording of one such situation and never wanted to see another. Morgan had not given the suspect the slightest semblance of a "fair fight" that would allow them to die with their pride intact. Instead, he had used the full extent of his abilities as an *einherjar*. Armored in defiance and wielding a blade of incandescent rage, Morgan had methodically broken down a suspect whose original crime had been wage theft and sexual harassment. When the suspect begged him to end his suffering, Morgan withheld the *coup de grace* and condemned him to life. Had this suspect not taken hostages, it might have ended with him paying a ruinous fine and being debarred from further employment in a managerial capacity.

Then there were the theurgists, mostly people with congenital pseudofeline morphological disorder who had manifested a minor wild talent, who made pacts with angels for unearned preternatural power. Their like could not be afforded the due process of law, because putting them on trial would entail acknowledging that the power to impose one's will upon the world by calling upon inhuman powers was available to those willing to pay the price. It was hardly knowledge the Phoenix Society wanted generally available. There were only a few Adversaries and Peacemakers with the requisite knowledge and ability to deal with the existing caseload of theurgists and angel visitations, Morgan was one of the, and he was hard-pressed to deal with his share of the burden.

It was with this understanding that Annelise rationalized her initial impulse to send her life as Christabel up in flames, hoping that the conflagration might conceal her flight. "You two weren't there when Morgan came back from Shenzhen. You never saw the songs he picks when we do covers. All of his choices are melancholic songs about regret, failure, and guilt like 'Small Dark Lines', 'Tonight He Grins Again', or 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers'. He's on the edge of burnout, this close to breaking his sword over his knee and walking away. If you're going to turn him against Sabaoth now is the time."

"And you think framing him for Christabel's murder is the way to set him on the path?"

Almost as angry with Elisabeth as she had become with herself, Annelise snapped at her. "If you've got a better idea it's a bit bloody late to say so. We -- *I* -- should have told him everything. Hell, Naomi probably knows more than she's ever admitted. We should have sat him down and told him what's really going on."

"Do you think he would have believed you?"

"Fucked if I know," said Annelise, letting the persona she had cultivated over a decade slip ever further. Her Brooklyn had come out as she spoke. "He's not as stupid as I've pretended to think he is because that's what Christabel thinks of him. If you had told him that it might be possible to deal with the theurgists and angel attacks by whacking Sabaoth, he'd probably *pounce* on the opportunity."

"Isaac isn't content with removing Sabaoth from the picture."

"No shit, Sherlock." Annelise openly glared at Elisabeth now. "Isaac is sure that he and the rest of you *ensof* need to be removed from power. Thing is, if Morgan comes after him with the unbound Starbreaker the whole planet's fucked. You need Morgan to be so righteously pissed off with the guy that he finds a way to break Isaac and *sentence him to life*."

It was a tall order; that much Annelise knew. In the privacy of her thoughts she had classified Morgan's states of indignation into several fancifully-named categories: low dudgeon, high dudgeon, Malmsteen-esque fury, Homeric rage, Shakespearean wrath. None of these would do; the latter Morgan reserved for suspects who harmed the innocent or murdered his fellow Adversaries in the line of duty. To find a way to control the Starbreaker so that he did not run amok and commit indiscriminate mass deicide he would need the serene fury of the Buddha, and Annelise was not sure Morgan was capable of such a transcendant state belanced between righteous anger and loving kindness.

Samuel seemed to understand. "You're hoping he'll figure out he's being manipulated and set about figuring out who's playing him, how, and why."

"I talked a good game about giving him the facts and letting him decide," said Annelise, "But if we did that *now* he'd think we were conning him. He needs to figure it out on his own, and he needs a swift kick up the ass to get him going because right now he's being all emo about whatever happened in Shenzhen and the end of Crowley's Thoth."

The arch tone was back in Elisabeth's voice. "Are you sympathetic toward Morgan or not?"

Annelise shrugged. "It doesn't matter how *I* feel; he can have his existential crisis *after* he's saved the world. Just make sure his therapist gets hazard pay."
