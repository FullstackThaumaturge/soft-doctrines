### Imaginos
*Crouch End, Winter Solstice, 23:58 - 100 years after Nationfall*

The clouds looming overhead like a densely packed armada of dirigibles carpet-bombed London with fresh, fluffy snow that crunched beneath the soles of my shoes as I stepped out of my limousine in front of Christabel Crowley's row house. I had expended considerable effort in reshaping what had begun as a minor weather system likely to give London little more than a dusting. It was rough sorcery, hardly up to my usual exacting standards, but if you know of a wild talent capable of doing better on such short notice please introduce them to me so that I can put them on my payroll — or arrange their disappearance should they prove recalcitrant. 

The storm had been Christabel's idea. It would have been the perfect night to stage her murder without it, but after the decade of good service she has given me refusing to cater to her taste for drama seemed needlessly churlish. Besides, who doesn't dream of a white Solstice with every overpriced greeting card they write? Nevertheless, the crimson-tinted blizzard was rather convenient for my purposes. No need to obscure my presence with a more localized bit of thaumaturgy when giving nature a swift kick served my purposes equally well.

It hardly mattered if anybody remained awake at this hour. Neither a constable walking a punishment beat or a child hoping to see a merry madman burglarizing their house in search of sweets would see *me*. Nor would they see my companion. The a pale brunette, a dead ringer for Christabel, lay in my arms deeply asleep wrapped within the white wool greatcoat that matched my double-breasted bespoke suit.

Being a demon — one of the *ensof* if demonology is your field of pedantry[^1] — I hardly needed the coat but it made for good theater. I could hardly play the gallant, dashing tech magnate without wrapping my date in my coat to see her home in comfort.

Light filled the doorway of the house adjacent to Christabel's as I approached. The golden glow turned the night-darkened door a fierce scarlet that matched the eyes of its owner and that of her father. Though I hid my own lambent eyes behind a cool blue illusion, we were both demifiends and bore the mark of our ancestry. She might have gotten my eyes, but the molten determination with which she faced me despite the hour proved her more her mother's daughter.

I had not expected Naomi Bradleigh to be home, especially on the Solstice, but I suppose the events that had led me here had proven rather trying for all involved. She had wrapped herself in a thick terrycloth robe, and held a naked sword in her hand. I knew that platinum-veined eigengrau blade of old, forged of a stable transuranic heavy metal not yet given a seat at the periodic table, and it knew *me*. It radiated black menace, a halo of darkness devouring light that should have illuminated its keeper as she pushed aside a cascade of frost-pale hair that the wind had blown in her face with a gesture that left me aching for a moment with the memory of her mother.

"Is that Christabel?" Naomi raised her voice in indignation, heedless of the hour. Perhaps she expected the snowfall to keep her voice from carrying too far. "What did you *do* to her?"

"I'm guilty of nothing more than negligence." Hardly my first lie to my daughter, and unlikely to be my last — or the least of them. "I had turned my back on her for a moment, and somebody offered her a drink. She had already had a few too many so she didn't think to test it before tasting."

"Am I to believe you're being a gentleman, making sure she gets home safely?" Despite her scorn. or because of it, she still raised her sword slightly and approached. It was not fear that made her shiver, but the now calf-deep snow spilling into her unlaced boots.

"Surely one can be both gentleman and bastard, depending on the situation — or the person."

Naomi remained silent a moment, her eyes narrowing and the hand with which she gripped her sword clenching tighter. No doubt she was likewise tightening her grip on a temper straining at the leash. "Bastard is hardly the word I would choose when characterizing you, Dr. Magnin. It *is* still Isaac Magnin, is it not? Or will you shed that name as you once shed that of Ian Malkin?"

No doubt I will, but there was no need to tell Naomi that. The names by which she knew me were but the latest in a succession of aliases.

A sudden gust caught the collar of her robe, exposing the Judas medal resting beneath the hollow of her throat for a moment before she pulled it closed again with her free hand. The bronze medallion, embossed with a noose and a coin, marked her as one of the Iscariotine Order, named for a patron saint of traitors venerated only by heretics. It was a constant reminder of the ideals and people she had betrayed in service to *her* notion of the greater good. 

If she were to raise her sword now, she could shatter my avatar, but she would not do that. After all, she thought I had her former bandmate cradled in my arms, and no Adversary worthy of the name would risk harm to an innocent to cut down the guilty[^2]. "Can we continue this inside? You might have noticed that it's cold outside, and I would hate for you to add frostbite to your list of crimes."

"I would love to, but I don't have a key on me, and it would hardly do to drop her in the snow so that I can rifle her pockets."

Naomi glared at me, slowly shaking her head. "Am I to believe that you came here without the slightest semblance of a plan for getting into Christabel's house? Did you honestly think I would help you after tonight's farce?"

It was hardly the first time that Christabel had taken her role as prima donna rock violinist a little too far, but tonight had been a *tour de force* resulting in the thoroughly public dissolution of Crowley's Thoth. That I had not thought to expect Naomi's current presence was of little conseqence; this was not my first improvisation, and the stage was set for Christabel's murder. Her catastrophic falling-out with her bandmates -- Naomi Bradleigh and Morgan Cooper -- would ensure that they and their friends would have more pressing concerns than my efforts to write the next act in what was sure to become a rock opera despite my best intentions. 

"As interesting as it might be to confirm that Christabel had already thought to change the locks, I've asked my daemon to notify Christabel's." Naomi pressed a fingertip to her ear to indicate that she was communicating with her household artificial intelligence. "Unfortunately, Aleister isn't responding."

This, however, was part of the plan. It was an indication that Ashtoreth and Sathariel, two fellow *ensof* who had inducted me into their order, had succeeded in preceeding me here. They would have brought with them somebody capable of disabling Aleister from inside while overriding the failsafes that would have disengaged the locks in the event of a shutdown.

A bit of ad hoc thaumaturgy would suffice to short out the locks; a handful of milliseconds and the merest trickle of power from a nearby tesla point was all I needed. Trivial compared to my previous efforts, really. A second more and a little more power allowed me to set up a delayed charm that would scramble Naomi's short term memory. It would trigger as soon as I was a kilometer away from her, and she would not remember finding me at Christabel's doorstep just before midnight or helping me get into Christabel's house. At least, not until some of her old friends at MEPOL[^3] roust her out of bed and arrest her as a suspect in a murder they have every reason to believe she committed.

No doubt their counterparts in New York would do the same to Morgan, sure that *he* had every reason to execute her for the crime of rejecting him and shattering his dreams. Who had abetted whom would not matter; each would race to be the first to persuade *their* suspect to implicate the other. I do love a good prisoner's dilemma, but I doubt either will be capable of breaking their respective prisoners. 

"It's sorted. Would you kindly get the door? I'd hate to knock Christabel's head against the doorframe. Poor dear's likely to wake up with a splitting headache as it is and hardly needs a concussion in the bargain."

"More of your magic?" Naomi dismissed my practiced *this-is-too-clever-to-explain-to-mere-mortals* smile and tightened her grip on her sword. No doubt she remembered our little heart-to-heart in Clarion, and my emphatic demonstration of the consequences of self-righteous idealism should she not choose the sensible course of silence. She raised her sword a little, as if she wanted to brandish it against me but did not quite dare. "Never mind. I would rather you didn't explain it. I'd rather just make sure you get Christabel to bed and then fuck off so that I can go back to sleep and pretend this was all just an especially crap dream."

With that, she let me into Christabel's house. I had expected her to close the door behind me, but she followed me through the front hallway and up two flights, all the while feeling not only her sword's craving to rend me asunder but her determination to foil whatever nastiness I had in mind.

[^1]:	You will not find me named in the *Ars Goetia* or any of the other commonly known grimoires, and rather than summoning me with a blood sacrifice you could simply send email to earth!asgartech!mimir!isaac.magnin. If Mimir can't handle it on my behalf, I will get back to you — an eventuality you might even live to regret.

[^2]:	This otherwise admirable quality has proven the death of a good many Adversaries, but when their deaths come at the hands of my more knowledgable enemies, it gives me an excuse to have them assassinated rather than giving them a forum with which to expose me in the name of due process.

[^3]:	MEPOL being the Metropolitan Police of London. Naomi had a bit of a history with them as a younger woman; as an Adversary she regularly visited to crack down on officers who abused their authority. Doubtless somebody there remembers her — and holds a grudge.
