### Annelise
*Crouch End, 22 December, 01:30 - 100 years after Nationfall*

It was strange to be a ghost in one's own home, but had it ever been Annelise Copeland's in the first place? She considered the backdrop of the life she had lived for the past decade. From the shelves of books she had only skimmed to the framed posters of silent Expressionist films through which she had fast-forwarded, none of it was to her taste; they had merely been useful props. Like the violin she had learned to play, they were the whole cloth out of which a method actor fashioned the character they played. They were *de rigeur* for somebody like Christabel Crowley, a bohemian sort who had adopted her alliterative alias to hide posh origins that natives of her chosen milieu found unsavory.

Distinguishing between Christabel's perceptions of the world and her own required a dual consciousness that Annelise had once thought impossible in her youthful naivety. It was hard enough being oneself. It had often seemed to her that few dared attempt it, and fewer still succeeded. Still more difficult was the work of keeping that true self from being crushed beneath the weight of a long-cultivated persona.

Tonight would be Christabel's curtain call and her own rebirth. It would be her first step away from the insanity that had nibbled at the edges of her world ever since had allowed a honey-tongued sorcerer in white to intrigue her. It was, now that she thought of it, a step long overdue; she had reached the point where she needed to break character before her character broke her.

Concealed by the arts of one of his fellow magi, she watched as Isaac Magnin laid a doppelg√§nger of the woman she had been on Christabel's bed and tenderly tucked her in. Her neighbor and former bandmate Naomi Bradleigh followed close behind, a naked sword in hand as if she suspected foul play or its imminence. Rather than leaving with Isaac, Naomi had settled into Annelise's favorite armchair with that queer platinum-veined sword across her lap.

"That certainly took longer than I might have preferred," said Elisabeth Bathory as she stepped from the shadows, her contralto whisper full of the last somnolent notes of her witches' lullaby. Naomi had fought it valiantly, jerking awake after dozing and glancing about several times, but finally yielded to the ensof's will.

Samuel Terell gently tucked an errant lock of Elisabeth's midnight hair behind her ear as he too emerged to consider the tableau before them. "Do you suppose Ms. Bradleigh possessed some innate resistance to your workings?"

"I wouldn't dismiss the possibility," said Elisabeth. "But if that were the case, Samuel, she might have resisted your thaumaturgies as well. I suspect she was merely determined to remain awake and watch over Christabel."

Annelise glanced toward Naomi, who remained asleep. "Should we be talking? What if she hears us?"

Samuel's reply came in a clipped tone. "I have been a spy, a smuggler, an assassin, and a journalist. I know a few things about concealment."

Putting Samuel's boast to the test, Annelise slowly opened the closet door. It was still mostly full; nothing remained that she had wanted to take with her. Furthermore, emptying the closet might lead anybody investigating the scene to suspect that there was more to the story than they were supposed to see, a deeper truth to be read between the lines. Shoving aside a succession of dresses and gowns she had only worn once a year, she reached into a dark corner and retrieved a short sword in a lacquered scabbard.

Slowly drawing the sword, she admired its rippled steel in the soft lamplight. Morgan had left the weapon here intentionally, sure that it might prove useful if somebody broke in. That had never happened; now Annelise had kept the weapon because selling it or giving it away would have raised suspicion. It was a Nakajima blade, custom work easily identified by those with an eye for swords and access to the network; now it would be the key that unlocked her prison.

If only she could plunge it into Christabel's breast herself, but that would hardly do. She would be incriminating herself and rendering pointless the entire exercise. Instead, it would be Isaac who struck the fatal blow. With Aleister shut down, there would be no recording of the deed, nothing to guide investigators but whatever circumstantial evidence her patron chose to arrange.

It was clear, however, that the script for this final act in the life of Christabel Crowley was not to Elisabeth's taste. "Annelise, are you sure you've thought this through?"

"It's a bit late to suggest that you have a better idea," said Annelise, indicating the sleeping double.

"Christabel can still die. Need it be by Morgan's hand? Isaac has already established that she had had too much to drink earlier tonight, and had subsequently been drugged. It would be a simple enough matter to make it appear that she had overdosed and expired in her sleep."

It was an idea Annelise had already considered and discarded. "It's a bit late for me to join the twenty-seven club."

"So, you *want* to frame Morgan for your murder, and possibly drag Naomi into it as an accessory. Are you that determined to have the world see Morgan as you do, a monster pretending to be a man? Is this a matter of vengeance?"

That was a question with which Annelise had wrestled ever since Morgan had gone haring off to Shenzhen[^5] a couple of nights before the semiannual Solstice Pops concert at the Royal Albert Hall. He had returned barely in time to join Crowley's Thoth on stage and had been in full uniform, disheveled, and still stinking of violence. That had been the final straw. She had begged Isaac to accelerate the plan. It was only fitting; Winter Solstice was the perfect night for murder. "I've had my fill of revenge. The look on Morgan's face when I ended the band was priceless."

Glancing at Naomi, who remained asleep, Annelise lowered her voice. "He would have dumped me and quit years ago if not for Naomi. Crowley's Thoth wouldn't have become what it was without her, and he didn't want it to be yet another band that had imploded around her."

"It almost sounds as if you had been wrong about him all along," said Elisabeth, her arch tone leavened with something Annelise suspected to be compassion.

"Maybe I was." Annelise spoke softly, as if admitting this more to herself than to Elisabeth and Samuel. "I spent years sure I understood Morgan. I thought he loved being an Adversary as much as he did being on stage with me and Naomi. I was sure that with every mission he happily conducted symphonies of destruction. But when he came back reeking of blood, gunpowder, and ozone all I could see was my *idea* of him."

It had been an error for which Annelise would not easily forgive herself. She had known better, had trained herself to see past the posturing and theatrics with which Morgan Cooper created the image of a relentless avenger of the downtrodden. His weapons bore the motto *nemo me impune lacessit* not as a boast, but as a warning[^6]. Those who tried and failed to strike Morgan down carried their regrets to unmarked graves. Those who succeeded secured but a fleeting victory, for once Morgan had repaired himself he would resume the hunt with renewed conviction.

Though Annelise had initially dismissed these antics as Morgan's efforts to make his job easier by weaponizing terror, she received periodic updates to his dossier and could not ignore the truth of his actions on the job. His understanding of his interdependence with the world around him was deeper than he had ever let on. If a suspect was set on death because the legally prescribed punishment for their crimes was expropriation of their wealth and exile, which would impoverish their otherwise blameless families, Morgan would oblige them with as gentle a death as one could provide with a blade. All he asked was that they strike the first blow, that he might be justified in the use of deadly force.

However, if a suspect harmed innocent people or attacked a fellow Adversary, it was not a compassionate sword that awaited them. Annelise had seen a recording of one such situation and never wanted to see another. Morgan had not given the suspect the slightest semblance of a "fair fight" that would allow them to die with their pride intact. Instead, he had used the full extent of his abilities as an *einherjar*. Armored in defiance and wielding a blade of incandescent rage, Morgan had methodically broken down a suspect whose original crime had been wage theft and sexual harassment. When the suspect begged him to end his suffering, Morgan withheld the *coup de grace* and condemned him to life. Had this suspect not taken hostages, it might have ended with him paying a ruinous fine and being debarred from further employment in a managerial capacity.

Then there were the theurgists, mostly people with congenital pseudofeline morphological disorder who had manifested a minor wild talent, who made pacts with angels for unearned preternatural power. Their like could not be afforded the due process of law, because putting them on trial would entail acknowledging that the power to impose one's will upon the world by calling upon inhuman powers was available to those willing to pay the price. It was hardly knowledge the Phoenix Society wanted generally available. There were only a few Adversaries and Peacemakers with the requisite knowledge and ability to deal with the existing caseload of theurgists and angel visitations, Morgan was one of the, and he was hard-pressed to deal with his share of the burden.

It was with this understanding that Annelise rationalized her initial impulse to send her life as Christabel up in flames, hoping that the conflagration might conceal her flight. "You two weren't there when Morgan came back from Shenzhen. You never saw the songs he picks when we do covers. All of his choices are melancholic songs about regret, failure, and guilt like 'Small Dark Lines', 'Tonight He Grins Again', or 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers'. He's on the edge of burnout, this close to breaking his sword over his knee and walking away. If you're going to turn him against Sabaoth now is the time."

"And you think framing him for Christabel's murder is the way to set him on the path?"

Almost as angry with Elisabeth as she had become with herself, Annelise snapped at her. "If you've got a better idea it's a bit bloody late to say so. We -- *I* -- should have told him everything. Hell, Naomi probably knows more than she's ever admitted. We should have sat him down and told him what's really going on."

"Do you think he would have believed you?"

"Fucked if I know," said Annelise, letting the persona she had cultivated over a decade slip ever further. Her Brooklyn had come out as she spoke. "He's not as stupid as I've pretended to think he is because that's what Christabel thinks of him. If you had told him that it might be possible to deal with the theurgists and angel attacks by whacking Sabaoth, he'd probably *pounce* on the opportunity."

"Isaac isn't content with removing Sabaoth from the picture."

"No shit, Sherlock." Annelise openly glared at Elisabeth now. "Isaac is sure that he and the rest of you *ensof* need to be removed from power. Thing is, if Morgan comes after him with the unbound Starbreaker the whole planet's fucked. You need Morgan to be so righteously pissed off with the guy that he finds a way to break Isaac and *sentence him to life*."

It was a tall order; that much Annelise knew. In the privacy of her thoughts she had classified Morgan's states of indignation into several fancifully-named categories: low dudgeon, high dudgeon, Malmsteen-esque fury, Homeric rage, Shakespearean wrath. None of these would do; the latter Morgan reserved for suspects who harmed the innocent or murdered his fellow Adversaries in the line of duty. To find a way to control the Starbreaker so that he did not run amok and commit indiscriminate mass deicide he would need the serene fury of the Buddha, and Annelise was not sure Morgan was capable of such a transcendant state belanced between righteous anger and loving kindness.

Samuel seemed to understand. "You're hoping he'll figure out he's being manipulated and set about figuring out who's playing him, how, and why."

"I talked a good game about giving him the facts and letting him decide," said Annelise, "But if we did that *now* he'd think we were conning him. He needs to figure it out on his own, and he needs a swift kick up the ass to get him going because right now he's being all emo about whatever happened in Shenzhen and the end of Crowley's Thoth."

The arch tone was back in Elisabeth's voice. "Are you sympathetic toward Morgan or not?"

Annelise shrugged. "It doesn't matter how *I* feel; he can have his existential crisis *after* he's saved the world. Just make sure his therapist gets hazard pay."
