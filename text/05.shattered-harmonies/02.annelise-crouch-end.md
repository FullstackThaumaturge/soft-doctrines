### Annelise
*Crouch End, 22 December, 01:30 - 100 years after Nationfall*

It was a strange thing to be almost a ghost in one's own house, but it was hardly the first bit of weirdness Annelise Copeland had experienced in her decade of service to the sorcerer in white who had carried a doppelganger of the woman she had been -- Christabel Crowley -- and laid her in Annelise's bed. Her old bandmate, Naomi, had followed close behind Isaac with a naked sword in her hand as if she suspected foul play or its imminence.

Shielded by some magic one of Isaac's colleagues wielded, Annelise had watched as Naomi settled into her favorite armchair, laid that queer platinum-veined sword across her lap, and kept watch over Christabel as she lay sleeping in the bed Annelise had once thought her own. Though she had made a valiant effort, jerking awake every time she dozed and looking about as if startled, sleep eventually reclaimed her.

"That certainly took longer than I might have preferred," said Elisabeth Bathory. The pale, aristocratic brunette spoke softly in a contralto register that still retained a hint of a central European accent.

Her companion, Samuel Terell, gently tucked an errant lock of Elisabeth's hair behind her ear. He had been one of Elisabeth's lovers for as long as Annelise had been acquainted with them, and if Isaac had not been her occasional paramour in addition to being her employer Annelise might not have believed that these magicians, these *ensof*, were capable of love and desire.

"Do you suppose Ms. Bradleigh possessed some innate resistance to your workings?"

"I wouldn't dismiss the possibility," said Elisabeth. "But if that were the case, Samuel, she might have resisted your thaumaturgies as well. I suspect she was merely determined to remain awake and watch over Christabel until she had awakened again."

Elisabeth had fixed Annelise with a pointed look as she said this last. "She has no idea that that *thing* in the bed isn't actually me?"

"I doubt it," said Samuel. "When you told Isaac that you had had enough and wanted out, but wanted to make as memorable an exit as possible, you presented him with a challenge he couldn't resist."

Annelise glanced toward Naomi, who remained asleep. "Should we be talking? What if she hears us?"

Samuel's reply came in a clipped tone. "I've been a spy, a smuggler, and an assassin long before I took up journalism. I've learned a few things about concealment."

That was part of the problem with keeping the company of immortals, and one of the reasons Annelise was determined to get out of this mess while she still could[^4].
